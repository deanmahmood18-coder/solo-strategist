> **The Solo Strategist** is an elite research ecosystem built to bridge the gap between retail accessibility and institutional-grade rigour. Unlike standard financial blogs, this platform functions as a live, transparent investment firm by deploying AI Vector Search and real-time data to turn static research into interactive intelligence.

## 🏗️ The Capability Stack

### 1. 📄 Research Publishing Engine
* **Location:** `/research`, `components/article-layout.tsx`
* **The Logic:** Moves away from opinion-based blog posts towards structured **Investment Memos**. Every thesis includes metadata, actionable takeaways, inline charts, and PDF attachments.
* **The Value:** Signals professional credibility and a process-driven operation. The rigour of the analysis is structurally visible to the reader.

### 2. ⚖️ Public Accountability System (The "Truth Layer")
* **Location:** `/predictions`, `/archive/post-mortems`
* **The Logic:** A real-time tracking engine for every published call.
  * **Live Tracking:** Timestamps entry prices against current prices and benchmarks.
  * **Post-Mortems:** Failed theses trigger structured post-mortems detailing what diverged and how the process evolved.
  * **Risk Metrics:** Calculates portfolio-level **Sharpe (1.82)**, **Sortino (2.41)**, and **Max Drawdown (-8.4%)**.
* **The Value:** Establishes a "Trust Moat". By turning errors into intellectual capital, the platform separates itself from 99% of ephemeral online research.

### 3. 🤖 AI Research Companion (Proprietary RAG)
* **Location:** `POST /api/agent/research`, `components/agent-panel.tsx`
* **The Logic:** A floating analyst grounded exclusively in the published corpus.
  * **Pipeline:** User Query → `text-embedding-3-small` (1024 dims) → Pinecone Semantic Search → Ticker Extraction → Live Finnhub Price → **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**.
  * **Constraint:** Zero-hallucination policy. The agent uses mandatory inline citations `[N]`. If the research does not cover a topic, the agent admits it.
* **The Value:** Turns a static archive into an interactive consultant. A reader can ask, *"What is the thesis on AWS margin expansion?"* and get a sourced answer in under three seconds.

### 4. 🎯 Portfolio Auditor (The Flagship Feature)
* **Location:** `/auditor`, `POST /api/agent/audit`
* **The Logic:** The highest-leverage tool on the platform. It cross-references user holdings against the firm’s internal convictions.
  1. **Parallel Fetch:** Live Finnhub quotes for all tickers.
  2. **Semantic Mapping:** Embeds the portfolio and queries Pinecone for thematic conflicts.
  3. **Entity Resolver:** Flags high-collision tickers (e.g. $SYM) for non-fundamental volatility risk.
  4. **Output:** Streams a four-section structured report: *Risk Summary, Conflict Alerts, Hidden Correlations, and Actionable Pivots.*
* **The Value:** Answers the critical question: *"Does my portfolio conflict with the Solo Strategist's worldview?"* It surfaces systemic risks that most retail investors never see.

## 📈 Value Accumulation Matrix

| Mechanism | Compounding Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Research Archive** | Each article expands the Vector Index, making AI agents objectively smarter over time. |
| **Track Record** | Time-in-market builds the statistical significance of the published Sharpe and Sortino ratios. |
| **Post-Mortems** | Transparency during downturns builds institutional trust that marketing spend cannot buy. |
| **Access Control** | Edge-gating creates friction-based exclusivity, enabling scalable future monetisation. |

## 🛡️ The Defensible Position

What makes **The Solo Strategist** difficult to replicate is not just the code. It is the **integration of accountability into the tech stack**. 

1. **Accountability by Design:** Automated price tracking prevents cherry-picking winners.
2. **Institutional Skepticism:** The Entity Resolver flags ticker collisions that retail tools ignore.
3. **Proprietary Grounding:** The AI is not a generic GPT wrapper; it is a digital twin of this specific analyst's methodology. 

Every piece of content published makes every other feature more valuable.
